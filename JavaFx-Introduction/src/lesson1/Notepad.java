	 * What is JavaFX
	 * 
	 * -Media/graphical framework for creating GUI's for java applications
	 * -JavaFx is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE
	 * -More powerfull
	 * -Used to create both desktop and web applications
	 * -Like swing draws it's own components, less communication with os
	 * -lightweigh and hardware accelerated
	 * -makes use of FXML - new XML-bases marku-up language for defining ULs
	 * 
	 * 	Why use it?
	 * 
	 * -oracle provides you with JavaFX scene builder
	 * 	-visual ui design tool
	 * 	-no need to spend n-hours anymore on trying to move a button a little bit to the left
	 * -ability to apply CSS on the components of the UI opens a door for better looking applications
	 * that are more attractive to the end-user
	 * -3D support (possibility of games cropping up)
	 * 
	 * -before version 2.0, javafx made use of javafx script
	 * -javafx script - propietary screping language deprecated
	 * 
	 * from 2.0 onwards, fxml has been introduced
	 * 	-more powerful and xml-based
	 * 	-all developers have knowledge of xml
	 * fxml - declarative xml-based language
	 * (<?import javafx.scene.control.Label?>
	 * <label text="hello, world"/>
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * JavaFx or swing/awt
	 * -gui's are created a lot faster than in swing and awt
	 * -moresophisticated and aesthetically pleasing ui
	 * -easy integration of sounds, images and videos and of web content
	 * -code is simplified in javafx by separating the ui from the login of the application
	 * -javafx can be integrated in swing applications, allowing for a smoother transistion
